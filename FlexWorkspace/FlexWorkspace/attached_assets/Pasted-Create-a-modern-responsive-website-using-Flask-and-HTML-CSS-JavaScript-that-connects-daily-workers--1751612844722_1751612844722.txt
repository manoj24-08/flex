Create a modern, responsive website using Flask and HTML/CSS/JavaScript that connects daily workers like plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and maids directly with customers. The site should include: a beautiful homepage with images and descriptions, a worker registration form, a searchable/filterable list of workers, and mobile-friendly design. Focus on clean UI, ease of navigation, and professional layout. Include service icons or images, testimonials, and contact info. Use Bootstrap for styling and SQLite for backend data storage.Build a full-stack web application using Flask, HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and SQLite that connects daily workers such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and maids directly with customers. The application should have separate registration and login pages for two types of users: "workers" and "customers." Workers will register with details like name, skill, phone number, location, email, and password (hashed using Werkzeug). Customers will register with name, email, phone number, location, and password (also hashed). Use Flask sessions to manage login states. After login, customers should be able to view a list of available workers, filtered by nearby location and skill. Display worker information such as name, skill, phone number, and location, along with a button to call (using tel: links) or optionally open WhatsApp chats. Include pages like index.html (a homepage with a clean UI, service introduction, and navigation), register_user.html, login_user.html, register_worker.html, login_worker.html, and workers.html to show available workers. Style everything using Bootstrap for a professional and responsive layout. Use SQLite to store users and workers in two separate tables, initializing them if they don’t exist. The project should include proper folder structure: templates/ for HTML files, static/ for custom CSS, and a database file. The app should start with app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=81) for Replit compatibility. Include filters and search options on the worker listing page for a better user experience."Add a database".Build a Flask web app with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and SQLite that connects daily workers like plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and maids with users. Add complete functionality to view and contact workers after user login. Each user must register and login with name, email, phone number, password, and location. Each worker must register and login with name, skill, phone number, location, email, and password. Store all data securely using SQLite and hash passwords using Werkzeug. After logging in, users should be able to view a "Find Workers" page showing a list of available workers in the same location as the logged-in user. Add a filter dropdown to search by skill (e.g., plumber, electrician). Each worker card should display full details: name, skill, phone number, location, and a “Call” button that uses tel: to make a direct call. Also add a “WhatsApp” button that opens a prefilled chat using https://wa.me/ with the worker’s number. Fix any bugs so that the logged-in user's location is correctly matched with workers in the same location. The database should contain two tables: users and workers, and the session should remember the user's location for filtering. Organize the files with templates (register_user.html, login_user.html, register_worker.html, login_worker.html, workers.html) and static folder for CSS. Use Bootstrap 5 for a clean and mobile-friendly UI. The app must run using app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=81) for Replit compatibility.
